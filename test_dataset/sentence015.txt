After they had eaten,  Goldberry  sang many songs for them, songs  that 
began  merrily  in the  hills and fell softly down into  silence; and in the 
silences they saw in their minds pools and  waters wider  than any  they had 
known, and looking into them they  saw the sky below them and the stars like 
jewels in the  depths.
